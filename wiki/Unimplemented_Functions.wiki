Items in <font color="red">red</font> are more urgent ones that should be done first.

Remove the section if you have done that part. Once everything is completed, this page shall disappear :).

Please mark down those items by <font color="green">your name</font> if they are under development that take more than one day to avoid duplicating effort.
